# Retail_Sales_Analysis
# Project Overview

This project showcases my SQL skills and data analysis techniques applied to retail sales data. The work involved cleaning raw data, exploring datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights. I created and managed a retail sales database, wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions, and analyzed sales performance across products, regions, and time periods.

# Objectives

1. Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
