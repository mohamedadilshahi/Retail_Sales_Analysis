# Retail_Sales_Analysis

Project Overview
This project showcases my SQL skills and data analysis techniques applied to retail sales data. The work involved cleaning raw data, exploring datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights. I created and managed a retail sales database, wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions, and analyzed sales performance across products, regions, and time periods.
